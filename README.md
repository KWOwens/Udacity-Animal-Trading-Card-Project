# Udacity-Animal-Trading-Card-Project
This is my very first project from the Udacity Front End Development Nanodegree Program
In this project, I had to design an online Animal Trading Card (ATC) to demonstrate the basic skills I learned using HTML.
Requirements included but were not limited to;
Font styling, Adding Colors, Boxes, Borders, Shadows and Images.
